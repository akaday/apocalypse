# Apocalypse

It's 2034, and zombies have taken over! 🧟 But tech still operates. What would you build to survive?

That's the premise of Apocalypse, a hackathon happening in downtown Toronto this May 17–19! If you're in high school, you should [sign up](https://join.apocalypse.hackclub.com) — we have travel stipends!

In this repository, you can check out the source code for [our website](https://apocalypse.hackclub.com)! Soon, we'll be open-sourcing deeper peeks into Apocalypse, like:

- Building the PCB hacker badge 🛠️
- Developing our theme 🌈
- Surprises from the organizing process 👀
